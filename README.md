Children today access online platforms widely, exposing them to both educational material and harmful content. Existing parental controls often fail to detect disguised explicit or violent content. The goal is to create an adaptive AI solution that protects children while allowing safe learning and communication.

Detailed Description:

Children today access social media, search engines, video platforms, and messaging apps, giving them exposure to both educational content and harmful material.
They may unintentionally encounter explicit sexual content, violent media, or abusive language while browsing online.
Existing parental controls are often too restrictive or too weak, either blocking healthy learning or failing to catch harmful content hidden through coded language, emojis, or altered media formats.
Most tools do not adapt to different age groups and lack real time detection across multiple platforms.
This creates a significant risk to children’s psychological development, safety, and overall digital well being.
Solution Capabilities Required:

Develop an intelligent, adaptive, real time filtering and monitoring system that reduces children’s exposure to explicit or harmful online content while still allowing safe learning, communication, and entertainment.
The solution must be age aware, adjusting safety levels based on the child’s maturity.
It should be platform independent, working across websites, apps, and media types.
It must be privacy respectful, avoiding unnecessary data storage or invasive monitoring.
It should accurately detect disguised adult content, including coded language, emojis, and modified images or videos.
Preferred Tech Stack:

Flutter for cross-platform application development
Firebase for backend services, authentication, and real-time data handling
TensorFlow for AI and content classification models
Elasticsearch for fast search, indexing, and retrieval of flagged content  this is my topic in a hackthon in gdg ranchi
